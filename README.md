# codeRhelpR
I created this custom, open-source reliability and analysis program for a specific use case in the [Laboratory for the Study of Child and Family Relationships](https://www.umdrubinlab.com/) at the University of Maryland. 

Additional information about the program will be added including an instruction manual and toy data sets. The current version requires customization from knowledgeable R users to fit different coding schemes. The long-term goal will be to allow users to easily specify their own coding schemes with separate files and via inputs to the program itself. 

If you do use this program in your academic or professional work, please cite:
