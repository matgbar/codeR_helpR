# codeRhelpR
I created this custom, open-source reliability and analysis program for a specific use case in the [Laboratory for the Study of Child and Family Relationships](https://www.umdrubinlab.com/) at the University of Maryland. 

Some initial toy data sets are available in the repository to provide users with a basic sense of the app's workflow. Additional detail and simple walkthroughs will be included as they are developed, along with more varied toy data sets that reflect different coding schemes and file formats. Please note that the software is provided as is. 

Note that data and the coding scheme file **must be in either .xls, .xlsx, .csv, or tab-delimited .txt formats**. No other filetypes are supported. 

If you do use this program in your academic or professional work, please cite:
